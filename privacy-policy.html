  <h1>FOG Golf League - Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>FOG Golf League ("the App") is a private golf league management application for the Friends of Golf (FOG) group. This policy explains what information the App collects and how it is used.</p>

    <li><strong>Golf Scores:</strong> Hole-by-hole scores entered during rounds.</li>
    <li><strong>Push Notification Tokens:</strong> Device tokens used to deliver push notifications about league updates. These are stored securely and used solely for sending league-related notifications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>All collected information is used exclusively for operating the FOG Golf League, including:</p>

    <li>Recording and displaying golf scores and standings</li>
    <li>Sending push notifications about round status and league announcements</li>
  </ul>
